## Overview

This project is a Challenge obtained from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) page.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories selected

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS preprocessor 
- JavaScript
- jQuery library

### What I learned

On this page I learned how to implement a JSON file to display the information contained, in addition to filtering the information depending on the categories selected by the user.

### Continued development

Make the page with real data possibly obtained from an API or integrating it to the JSON file already contained so that a list of real jobs is made.
